# Linux for DevOps

## Introduction
Linux is an **open-source operating system** that manages computer hardware, runs applications, and enables networking. It is the most widely used OS in **servers, cloud platforms, DevOps environments, and containers**.  

For DevOps, Linux is not optional — it’s a **core skill**:
- Most cloud servers (AWS, Azure, GCP) run Linux.
- Tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Ansible** rely heavily on Linux.
- Networking, security, and automation tasks are done best in Linux.

---

## 1. Basics of Linux
- **Kernel**: The heart of Linux that communicates with hardware.
- **Shell**: The program that takes commands from the user (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`).
- **Terminal**: The text-based interface where commands are entered.
- **Distributions (Distros)**: Versions of Linux such as Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Amazon Linux.

---

## 2. File System
Linux organizes data into a **hierarchical file system**:
- `/` → Root directory
- `/home` → User files
- `/etc` → Configurations
- `/var` → Logs and variable data
- `/bin` → Essential binaries
- `/usr` → User programs and libraries

### Useful Commands
```bash
pwd          # Show current working directory
ls -l        # List files with details
cd /path     # Change directory
mkdir test   # Create directory
rm file.txt  # Remove file
cp a b       # Copy file
mv a b       # Move/rename file
```
3. File Permissions

Every file in Linux has three types of permissions:

Read (r), Write (w), Execute (x)

Permissions apply to:

Owner (u)

Group (g)

Others (o)

```
Commands

ls -l                # View file permissions
chmod 755 file.sh    # Change permissions (rwxr-xr-x)
chown user:group f   # Change ownership

```

4. Processes & Services

Linux runs background processes and system services.

```
Commands

ps aux          # List all processes
top             # Monitor running processes
kill <PID>      # Kill process by ID
systemctl start nginx     # Start a service
systemctl stop nginx      # Stop a service
systemctl status nginx    # Check service status
```

5. Package Management

Linux distributions have package managers for installing/updating software.

Debian/Ubuntu: apt

CentOS/RHEL/Amazon Linux: yum or dnf

```
Commands 

# Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install nginx -y

# Amazon Linux / CentOS
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install nginx -y
```

## DevOps relevance:

Installing dependencies in servers.

Automating software installation in CI/CD pipelines.

6. Users & Groups

Linux supports multi-user environments with permissions controlled by groups.

```
Commands 
whoami                   # Show current user
id                       # Show user & group IDs
adduser devops           # Create new user
passwd devops            # Set password
usermod -aG sudo devops  # Add user to sudoers
groups                   # Show groups
```

DevOps relevance:

Managing multiple engineers on the same server.

Restricting access to production servers.

Following security best practices (not using root).

# Environment Variables: Summary for DevOps

## 1. What Are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are **dynamic values** stored in a system’s environment that programs and processes can access. They help configure the behavior of applications without hardcoding sensitive or system-specific data (like paths, credentials, or configuration options).

**Examples:**

* `PATH` → directories to search for executables.
* `HOME` → user’s home directory.
* `DB_HOST` → database server host (custom variable).

---

## 2. Common Commands for Environment Variables

### On Linux/macOS (Unix-based systems)

| Task                     | Command                 | Description                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| View all variables       | `printenv` or `env`     | Lists all environment variables             |
| View specific variable   | `echo $VAR_NAME`        | Displays value of `VAR_NAME`                |
| Set variable (temporary) | `VAR_NAME=value`        | Sets variable for the current session       |
| Set variable (exported)  | `export VAR_NAME=value` | Makes variable available to child processes |
| Unset variable           | `unset VAR_NAME`        | Removes a variable from the environment     |

### On Windows (Command Prompt & PowerShell)

| Task                     | Command                                                            | Description              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| View all variables       | `set` (CMD) or `Get-ChildItem Env:` (PowerShell)                   | Lists variables          |
| View specific variable   | `echo %VAR_NAME%` (CMD) or `$Env:VAR_NAME` (PowerShell)            | Shows value              |
| Set variable (temporary) | `set VAR_NAME=value` (CMD) or `$Env:VAR_NAME="value"` (PowerShell) | Available for session    |
| Set variable (permanent) | Use System Properties → Environment Variables                      | Persists across sessions |
| Remove variable          | `set VAR_NAME=` (CMD) or `Remove-Item Env:VAR_NAME` (PowerShell)   | Deletes variable         |

---

## 3. Relevance to DevOps

Environment variables are **critical in DevOps pipelines** for several reasons:

1. **Configuration Management**

   * Avoids hardcoding environment-specific settings.
   * Example: `DB_HOST`, `API_KEY`, `ENV=production`.

2. **Security**

   * Store secrets (passwords, tokens) without committing them to source code.
   * Often integrated with secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

3. **CI/CD Pipelines**

   * Used in tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions to pass environment-specific data between build, test, and deployment stages.

4. **Portability**

   * Makes applications portable across environments (development, staging, production) without changing code.

5. **Automation & Scripting**

   * Scripts can dynamically read variables to perform tasks based on the environment.
   * Example: `deploy.sh` can behave differently based on `ENV=staging` or `ENV=production`.

---

**Summary:**
Environment variables are like **dynamic system settings** that allow DevOps engineers to manage configuration, security, and automation efficiently across multiple environments and pipelines.


# Binary and Octal Representation: Summary

## 1. Binary Representation

Binary is a **base-2 numeral system** using only `0` and `1`. It's the foundation of all computer operations.

**Examples:**

* Decimal `5` → Binary `101`
* Decimal `10` → Binary `1010`

**Use in DevOps:**

* Configuring permissions (`chmod` in Linux uses binary/octal)
* Low-level network configurations

**Commands / Conversions:**

* Decimal to binary: `bin(10)` in Python → `'0b1010'`
* Binary to decimal: `int('1010', 2)` → `10`

---

## 2. Octal Representation

Octal is a **base-8 numeral system** using digits `0-7`. It's often used for Unix file permissions.

**Examples:**

* Decimal `8` → Octal `10`
* Decimal `64` → Octal `100`

**Use in DevOps:**

* File permissions: `chmod 755 file` (7→rwx, 5→r-x, 5→r-x)
* Representing grouped binary values concisely

**Commands / Conversions:**

* Decimal to octal: `oct(64)` in Python → `'0o100'`
* Octal to decimal: `int('100', 8)` → `64`

---

**Summary:**
Binary and octal are **numeral systems crucial for computing and DevOps** tasks, mainly for permissions, low-level configurations, and compact representation of data.
